# SmartEncrypt
A tool for encrypting files without all of the clutter of most programs.

All releases made will have a checksum that can be verified with [this.](https://bitbucket.org/nothingperfectsoft/applicationverifier/downloads/application-verifier.exe)

It is not recommended to download the sourcecode for actual use because it can contain bugs.


**UPCOMING FEATURES**

-Speed optimizations(reducing time.sleep() by a little)

-Password encryption using [pyAesCrypt](https://pypi.org/project/pyAesCrypt/)

-Improved Linux compatability(currently crashes when encrypting sometimes on linux)

-Commandline options to avoid going through tons of dialogues

-A possible GUI version

**OTHER PLANS**
